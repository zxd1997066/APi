Hint: enable_activation_checkpointing is True, but enable_activation_offloading isn't. Enabling activation offloading should reduce memory further.
Model is initialized with precision torch.bfloat16.
Memory stats after model init:
	XPU peak memory active: 15.02 GiB
	XPU peak memory alloc: 15.02 GiB
	XPU peak memory reserved: 15.14 GiB
Tokenizer is initialized from file.
